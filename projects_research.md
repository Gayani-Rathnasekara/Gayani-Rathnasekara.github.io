My research interests include:

- Polyphase digital architectures
- Massively parallel matrix–vector multiplication (MVM)
- RF and baseband signal processing
- Digital beamforming and MIMO
- ASIC-ready hardware accelerators

I focus on designs that transition from **FPGA prototype to custom digital silicon**.
