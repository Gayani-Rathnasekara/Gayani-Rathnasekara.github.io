I am a PhD candidate at Florida International University, working in the RAND Lab.
My research focuses on hardware-accelerated signal processing architectures
for RF, MIMO, and machine learning applications.

My work bridges algorithm design, FPGA prototyping, and ASIC-ready digital
architectures for real-time wideband systems.
